###Overview

This WebApi is developed to fetch investments for a user and further details on that investment. WebApi calls are hosted outside of the WebApplication. There are four Projects within the solution.  The WebApi uses an ApiKey. The one being used in the project is "MUlA8CBLy1yfYqkHLgtfpVy7"


- Nuix
  - Nuix is a project for General Functionality across the other projects.
- RingTail
  - RingTail is the project for the WebApi Functionality.
- RingTailStocks
  - RingTailStocks is the WebApplication that can be ran locally to view WebApi calls.
- UnitTests
  - Unit Tests is for running tests for the WebApi project to ensure information is being calculated and returned correctly.
 
###Assumptions
- Api is intended to query for one user at a time
- Api is currently only for fetching Stock details for the user.

###Process for Running

- After downloading the project and opening the solution file in the desired IDE, the user will run the RingTailStocks Project.
- The WebApplication that runs from this project will have a "Welcome Page".
- At the top of the "Welcome Page", there will be a menu item called "Current Investments"; this is where the user will be able to access the current investments for the default user.
- Each investment within the "Current Investment Page" will be clickable.
- Clicking the investment will open up the details for that particular investment. 
  - Note: The details page will also have a button labeled "View Raw Api Output" that allows the user to view the raw api output for the investment details.
